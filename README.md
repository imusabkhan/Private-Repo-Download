# GitHub Private Repository Downloader

This Python script allows you to download all your private repositories from GitHub to your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your machine.
- GitHub account with private repositories.
- Personal Access Token from GitHub with permissions to access your repositories.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the script `private_repo_down.py`.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install PyGithub
3. Replace the placeholder values in the script with your GitHub username and Personal Access Token.

## Usage
1. Run the script `python3 private_repo_down.py`.
2. It will authenticate with your GitHub account and fetch a list of your private repositories.
3. The script will create a directory specified in download_path (by default private_repositories) if it doesn't exist.
4. Each repository will be cloned or downloaded into the specified directory.

## Configuration
1. `username`: Your GitHub username.
2. `access_token`: Your Personal Access Token generated from GitHub.
3. `download_path`: The directory where repositories will be downloaded. Change this according to your preference.

## Notes
1. Ensure that your Personal Access Token has the necessary permissions to access your private repositories.
2. This script uses the `PyGithub` library to interact with the GitHub API.
3. Make sure you have enough disk space to download all your repositories.
